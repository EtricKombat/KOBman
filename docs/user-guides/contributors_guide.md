# Contributing to KOBman
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:


1. [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue raised related to the same should be mentioned in pull request!

## Bugs and New Features

We keep a distinction between New Features and Bugs/Issues. We try to minimise the noise in our Github Issues stream by first having a conversation on approprate media (eg:  [KochiOrgBook! Whatsapp Group](https://chat.whatsapp.com/El6d3aAc6pYLEDEdQPVABY). ) Initial discussion of new features or enhancements can be discussed in this whatsapp channel

### Report bugs using Github's issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/hyperledgerkochi/KOBman/issues); it's that easy!
After confirming the bug was found, an Issue may be raised filling in the provided issue template on the KOBman issue tracker.

### Process to add new feature

 - Explain the development requirements with the KOBman community
 - Start writing automation , by adding the new feature code and it's test script. 
 - Ensure that the entire community is aware of it to avoid duplication of your effort, by publishing your feature request in [Kanban board](https://github.com/orgs/hyperledgerkochi/projects/3) , [Issue Section](https://github.com/hyperledgerkochi/KOBman/issues)

## Processes expected to follow by each contributors:

- [Process for pull request](https://github.com/hyperledgerkochi/KOBman/blob/master/docs/user-guides/process-to-raise-a-pull-request.md)

- [Process for issues](https://github.com/hyperledgerkochi/KOBman/blob/master/docs/user-guides/process-to-raise-an-issue.md)

_______________________________________

**Unfortunately we will close any Github Issues that have not followed this process of prior discussion.**

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
[This is an example](https://github.com/asa1997/KOBman/issues/8) of a bug reported by a contributor .


_______________________________

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code snapshots if you can. [This contributor sample issue](https://github.com/asa1997/KOBman/issues/33) includes sample code snapshots that *anyone* can understand
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports.
